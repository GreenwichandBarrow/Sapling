<objective>
Analyze unreviewed decision traces, identify patterns and gaps, and propose prioritized improvements to the Personal OS. Calibrates the system to your preferences through human-approved changes.
</objective>

<usage>
```
/calibrate              # All unreviewed traces
/calibrate 2025-12-26   # Only traces from Dec 26
/calibrate 12-26        # Short form (assumes current year)
```
</usage>

<essential_principles>
1. **Per-item granularity:** Each decision/learning within a trace gets its own importance rating
2. **Three perspectives:** architecture-strategist, simplicity-advocate, pattern-recognizer analyze ALL items
3. **Cross-trace discovery:** Agents find patterns across traces that weren't visible during individual task execution
4. **Chatroom coordination:** Agents coordinate via chatroom to avoid duplicate proposals
5. **Human approval required:** All changes require explicit user approval before application
6. **Importance ranking:** Proposals sorted critical → high → medium → low
7. **Propose, don't overreach:** Small edits → apply directly. New skills → add to inbox for /create-skill
8. **Version tracking:** Each calibration bumps the OS version (VERSION file)
9. **Easy rollback:** Each calibration creates a single atomic commit that can be reverted
</essential_principles>

<quick_start>
1. Collect unreviewed traces
2. Create chatroom, spawn 3 analysis agents in parallel
3. Agents analyze, discover patterns, coordinate proposals
4. Present approval options (apply all / select / cancel)
5. Apply selected changes, mark traces as `review_status: applied`
6. Write calibration output ONCE → **hook auto-handles:** version bump, archive traces, update stats, stage all
7. Run /commit → single atomic commit with everything
8. Show evolution banner with level progress
</quick_start>

<workflow>
## Phase 1: Context Collection

Collect unreviewed traces using the helper script (avoids reading all files):

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/list-unreviewed-traces.py [date_filter]
```

**Examples:**
- `python3 .claude/scripts/list-unreviewed-traces.py` → all unreviewed
- `python3 .claude/scripts/list-unreviewed-traces.py 2025-12-28` → single date
- `python3 .claude/scripts/list-unreviewed-traces.py "2025-12-27 and 2025-12-28"` → multiple dates

**Script returns:**
- Trace paths, dates, tasks, targets
- Decision/learning counts per trace
- Total counts for summary

**System Inventory (paths only, agents read on-demand):**
- Skills: `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Hooks: `.claude/hooks/*.py`
- CLAUDE.md files: `CLAUDE.md`, `brain/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Schemas: `schemas/vault/*.yaml`
- **SOP:** `G&B Weekly Operating Schedule` in Google Drive (MANAGER DOCUMENTS / AI OPERATIONS). This is the master operating document showing team roles, daily deliverables, notification schedule, and event-driven workflows. Calibration agents MUST review this when proposing changes — any improvement that changes a deliverable, schedule, or notification must update the SOP as part of the change.
  - Drive folder ID: `1F98mmZy6I89YBA9GT_OrOum1Hn4wu9SG`

## Phase 2: Coordinated Analysis

Create chatroom with proper frontmatter, then spawn ALL 4 agents in parallel.

**Chatroom file:** `brain/traces/agents/{date}-calibrate.md`

```yaml
---
schema_version: 1.0.0
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
task: Calibration analysis of {n} traces from {date_filter}
agents: [coordinator, architecture-strategist, simplicity-advocate, pattern-recognizer]
status: active
---

# Agent Chatroom: Calibration Analysis

## Coordination Log
```

**Spawn 4 agents in ONE message using 4 Task tool calls:**

| Agent | Role | What It Does | Output Budget |
|-------|------|--------------|---------------|
| coordinator | Orchestration | Watches chatroom, waits for 3 `-> READY`, posts `-> CLOSE`, synthesizes all proposals | 3,000 words |
| architecture-strategist | Analysis | Reads traces, identifies gaps, posts findings + `-> READY` | 2,000 words |
| simplicity-advocate | Analysis | Reads traces, finds over-engineering, posts findings + `-> READY` | 2,000 words |
| pattern-recognizer | Analysis | Reads traces, finds patterns, posts findings + `-> READY` | 2,000 words |

**All 4 spawned by orchestrator (main conversation) using Task tool.**
All have hooks. All can write to chatroom. Coordinator doesn't spawn anyone - just coordinates.

**Give each agent:**
- Trace paths from script output (not contents)
- System inventory paths (not contents)
- Chatroom path
- Their specific role and output budget

**Orchestrator waits for coordinator's TaskOutput only.**
Coordinator returns synthesized report. Other 3 agents' outputs stay in their contexts.

## Phase 3: Proposal Generation

After all agents post `-> READY`:
1. Post `-> CLOSE` to chatroom
2. Collect TaskOutput from each agent
3. Deduplicate proposals (agents may identify same issue)
4. Merge importance ratings (take highest if disagreement)
5. Generate calibration proposal at `brain/outputs/calibrations/{date}-calibration.md`

## Phase 4: Human Approval

Present summary and options via AskUserQuestion:

```
CALIBRATION COMPLETE

Traces analyzed:     {count}
Proposals:           {count}
Learnings captured:  {count}

CRITICAL ({count})
  1. {target}: {title} ({trace_count} traces)
  ...

HIGH ({count})
  ...

What would you like to do?

[1] Apply all & commit
[2] Apply all & review first
[3] Select specific changes
[4] Cancel
```

## Phase 5: Application

Based on user choice:

**Option 1 (Apply all & commit):**
1. Apply each edit in sequence
2. Mark all processed traces as `review_status: applied`
3. Write calibration output file ONCE (with full content + Result banner) → **hook fires:**
   - Bumps VERSION (patch)
   - Moves applied traces to `brain/traces/processed/`
   - Updates `.claude/stats.yaml` with new count + level
   - Stages everything with `git add`
   - Returns message: "All changes staged. Run /commit to finalize."
4. Run `/commit` to create single atomic commit including ALL changes
5. Show evolution banner with level progress

**IMPORTANT:** Only write the calibration output file ONCE, at the very end. The hook triggers on this write and does all the housekeeping.

**Option 2 (Apply all & review first):**
- Apply edits but don't commit
- Show git diff for review
- Wait for user confirmation
- Then bump VERSION and continue with steps 4-6 above

**Option 3 (Select specific):**
- Ask which upgrades to apply (comma-separated numbers)
- Apply selected only
- Mark applied traces as `review_status: applied`
- Mark skipped traces as `review_status: skipped`
- Continue with steps 3-6 above

**Option 4 (Cancel):**
- No changes made
- Traces remain pending
- User can re-run later

<leveling_system>
Track progress in `.claude/stats.yaml`:

```yaml
total_traces_processed: {count}
total_calibrations: {count}
last_calibration: {date}
creature: ember  # ember | drift | bloom (set during /onboard)
```

**Evolution stages (faster first hatch):**
| Stage | Traces | Name | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | 0-9 | Egg | First calibration hatches it |
| 2 | 10-99 | Hatchling | Day 1 achievement |
| 3 | 100-499 | Juvenile | ~1-2 weeks |
| 4 | 500-1499 | Adult | ~1-2 months |
| 5 | 1500+ | Legendary | Long-term goal |

**Creature emoji map:**
| Creature | Emoji |
|----------|-------|
| ember | 🔥 |
| drift | 💧 |
| bloom | 🌿 |
| (none) | 🌱 |

**After applying changes:**
1. Count total traces with `review_status: applied`
2. Update `.claude/stats.yaml`
3. Calculate stage from trace count
4. If creature set: Read art from `.claude/creatures/{creature}/{stage}.txt`
5. Display evolution banner with creature
</leveling_system>

<rollback_protocol>
Every calibration creates a SINGLE atomic commit for easy rollback.

**Rollback command:** After committing, print `git revert <sha>` to terminal. Do NOT try to embed the commit SHA in the output file (this requires a two-commit pattern that adds complexity). The rollback command is ephemeral but sufficient.

**Evolution display after calibration:**

Shows after EVERY calibration - creature art (right) + metrics + changes in one compact screen.

**Creature art height by stage (grows as it evolves):**
| Stage | Height |
|-------|--------|
| Egg | 3 lines |
| Hatchling | 5 lines |
| Juvenile | 7 lines |
| Adult | 9 lines |
| Legendary | 11 lines |

**Layout principles:**
- Header combines: name · stage · version (compact)
- Metrics inline where possible
- Applied list flows alongside creature
- Separator above progress bar
- No wasted whitespace

If creature is set (user ran /onboard):

**Egg (3 lines):**
